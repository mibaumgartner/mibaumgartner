Welcome, my name is Michael and I am currently a Ph.D. student 🎓 in the Medical Image Computing Group (MIC) 🔭 at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg, Germany. My current work is focussed around object detection ([nnDetection](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnDetection)🫀🧠🫁), instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation in radiological images but I'm always looking for new projects to experiment with and learn from them. I have worked on several challenges and hackathons in the past and enjoy contributing to open source projects 👨‍💻 ([MONAI](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI) as Co-Chair of the Research Working Group, [Rising](https://github.com/PhoenixDL/rising), [Delira](https://github.com/delira-dev/delira)).
